RISC-V CPU Implementation
This project implements a RISC-V CPU using Verilog HDL, focusing on various instruction implementations and showcasing the design and simulation of a basic CPU architecture. Key features include the implementation of arithmetic, logical, and control instructions, with simulation and testing for correctness. The project structure contains source code files in the code/ directory, testbench files in the test/ directory, and simulation scripts in the simulation/modelsim/ folder, alongside Quartus project files (ricsv.qpf, ricsv.qsf, ricsv.qws) and a report file. To get started, clone the repository, open the .qpf file in Quartus, and use ModelSim for simulations. This project is inspired by the RISC-V architecture and is licensed under the MIT License.
